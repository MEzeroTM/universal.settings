#Universal Settings
This is where I store all my custom settings that I used throughout my text editors, IDE's, adobe software, etc...

### Compatibility
I use Linux, and Windows as my primary OS's so some settings may work for one that may not work for others. For example, Xresources are specifically made to work with the i3wm (i3 window manager) - another example is the vimrc, _vimrc = windows /.vimrc = Linux this file may switch back and forth from these formats so it is important to know which one you need.

### Why
This mostly started because of Nova Launcher & Adobe Illustrator, I found perfect settings but every time I would get a new OS (playing around with Linux) or ROM (playing around with jailbreaking) I would always loose these settings, and there really good! so I decided to start saving all my settings. I saw that a lot of people saved there dotfiles for Linux, but I use both so U.S is for everyone who enjoys a little bit of everything.
